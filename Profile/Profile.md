## Profile
The profile class is useful because it allows Magic to understand who people are. There are a few diffrent flavours of profiles but for the most part they hold the refrences Magic needs to create this understanding: Images, recordings of their voice, any special notes, and anything Magic might find useful.

It's important to remember that profiles are merely entries, a lookup table for a person. It should only ever hold refrences not actual data.
